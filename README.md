"Snake Game"
Welcome to the classic Snake Game implemented using the power of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS! 🐍🎮
This repository hosts a fun and nostalgic project where I've recreated the timeless Snake Game using fundamental web technologies. Dive into the world of retro gaming and enjoy the challenge of controlling the snake, growing it, and avoiding collisions with the walls and itself.
Features:
Built entirely with JavaScript for the game logic, HTML for structure, and CSS for styling.
Intuitive controls for an immersive gaming experience.
Dynamic rendering and gameplay mechanics that capture the essence of the original game.
Feel free to explore the code, tweak it, or expand upon it to make it your own! Whether you're reliving memories or exploring classic game development, this project serves as a fantastic starting point. Fork it, clone it, and start playing!

Let the snake-slithering fun begin! 🕹️🍎
